![B_R_F](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdwilliams11/Credit_Risk_Analysis/main/B_R_F.png)

* Accuracy Score: 78.78%


##### Easy Ensemble AdaBoost:
I could not get the .fit() to work for EasyEnsembleClassifier. I continued filling out the code for what I would have done had it worked. The output from the confusion matrix and classification report were already present in the starter code.
* Accuracy Score: ??
